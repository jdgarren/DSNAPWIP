# DSNAPWIP

This application will complete test Pre-Registrations for the FLA D-SNAP application.

Can comment out section and un-comment other existing section to stop application prior to e-sign.

Consumes a companion Excel File to parameterize values, can define specific data sets, or optionally employ 
secondary companion file to randomly generate all avaiable parameters, or employ a hybrid methodology.

This supports more intensive Unit Testing of the application from an automated standpoint and allows BA staff to focus more on outcomes and less on data creation.  Can also be employed to create large volume test data for staff development/process training use.
